# soil-c-macc

Repository for code used to develop simulations underlying soil C marginal abatement cost curve paper. The goal of this analysis is to build and implement a version of the IPCC (2019) steady-state model for soil carbon sequestration in global croplands, and to use this model as one part of the basis for a soil carbon marginal abatement cost curve.
